## Architecture
The School Management System follows a three-tier architecture:
- **Presentation Layer**: Built with Flutter, this layer includes all user interfaces and interactions.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Developed with Node.js, this layer contains all the application logic and processes.
- **Data Layer**: Powered by PostgreSQL, this layer handles data storage, retrieval, and management.

### Data Flow
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the Flutter app.
2. **API Requests**: The app sends API requests to the Node.js backend.
3. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the requests, performs necessary business logic, and interacts with the PostgreSQL database.
4. **Response**: Processed data is sent back to the Flutter app, which updates the UI accordingly.
